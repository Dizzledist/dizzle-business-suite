## Session 2026-11-06 / user with Codex: Phase 0 preparation

- **Task:** Establish documentation and shared domain contracts only.
- **Starting state:** main tracked origin/main at `aeab1c854041e3ee1ae4ed1ffd084c86738b687c`; fetched origin/main before branching. Tracked tree clean; only untracked file was `dizzle-business-suite.code-workspace`.
- **Branch / review:** `docs/phase-0-foundation`, based on that fetched commit. Draft PR publication outcome will be appended after push; no merge authorized by this task.
- **What changed:** README navigation; repository conventions; status, decisions, shared contracts, role matrix and concrete invoice-to-warehouse acceptance scenarios. Baseline PROJECT_SCOPE remains unchanged.
- **Modules/contracts affected:** Documentation for identity, account assignment, Zoho invoice/payment, fulfillment release and permissions (C1-C5). Both builders must review; no signoff or deployed behavior claimed.
- **Checks at preparation:** Read README and scope; verified branch, working tree, remote URL and fetched base. Final diff/link/staging checks and publication are recorded in the outcome entry.
- **Schema/environment:** None. No code, dependencies, infrastructure, credentials or live provider setup added.
- **External actions at preparation:** Read/fetch GitHub state. Task authorizes pushing the documentation branch and opening a draft PR; later outcome records completion.
- **Known failures/incomplete:** No app or runtime tests exist. Provider statuses, payment applications, freshness/event ordering and stock-impact contracts are unverified. Review/merge operator and active foundation lead are not yet assigned.
- **Decisions/blockers:** Confirmed rules and open Q01-Q11 are in [DECISIONS](DECISIONS.md). Proposed types/permissions are clearly labeled; unresolved provider behavior cannot establish release eligibility.
- **Next: sales manager:** Review C1-C5/permissions, define fixture-backed sales/owner account and invoice requirements, assignment/isolation cases and source mapping questions. Do not build a parallel connector.
- **Next: user / marketing lead:** Review C1-C5/permissions, define image studio/Assets approval, versioning, access and rep-consumption contract with sales manager. No live publishing/sends in that documentation task.
- **Next: shared foundation:** Appoint one lead, agree layout and shared reviews, then open a separate local scaffolding/isolated foundation task before Zoho integration. Main remains unchanged during this task.
